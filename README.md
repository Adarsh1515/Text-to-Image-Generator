The Text-to-Image Generator is an interactive web application that allows users to generate AI-based images from plain text descriptions using advanced models hosted on Hugging Face. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project integrates with the Hugging Face Inference API via a secure API key, making cutting-edge generative AI accessible directly from the browser.

This tool goes beyond basic image generation by giving users multiple customization options to enhance their creative control:

1.Model Selection: Users can choose from a range of powerful image generation models including:

  a.FLUX.1-dev

  b.FLUX.1-schnell

  c.Stable Diffusion v1.5

  d.Stable Diffusion XL

  e.Openjourney
  
  Each model offers a distinct artistic style or rendering speed to suit different creative needs.

2.Image Quantity: Users can select how many images to generate at once — 1, 2, 3, or 4 — allowing for visual variety and multiple interpretations of the same prompt.

3.Aspect Ratio Control: The generator supports different image formats, including:

  a. 1:1 (Square)

  b. 16:9 (Landscape)

  c. 9:16 (Portrait)
  
  This flexibility makes it ideal for creating content for social media, posters, and more.

4.Real-Time Preview & Download: Once generated, images are displayed instantly and can be downloaded directly.
